                <br>
                <p>PistachoSoft was created about 3 years ago (2011) as a ficticional company for a project on Business Management Basics. As we had very little to none imagination, <a href="https://twitter.com/RecuencoJones">@RecuencoJones</a> and his <strike>retardness</strike> imagination worked all together on creating a stupid, funny and catchy: PistachoSoft. </p>
                <p>After that project, for every other we had to do, same people (mostly), we used this funny, fake Company name so as to have kind of... status, or was it to have a better approach to people by making it friendly? Duh...it was done, and it was to be used!</p>
                <p>Soon many projects came beneath PistachoSoft's Domain.
                <p>You can browse them <a href="#/projects">here</a>!</p>
